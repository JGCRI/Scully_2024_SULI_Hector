"Equivalence information: Equivalence substances CFC-11-eq (summarizing all gases, except CO2, CH4, N2O and CFC-12), CFC-12-eq (summarizing all ODS) and HFC-134a (summarizing all other flourinated compounds) were aggregated using approximate linear radiative efficiencies. This is only a rough approximation for CO2, CH4, and N2O.",,,,,,,
